This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to open a URL in a different app.  The problem arises when the URL scheme used isn't registered on the device, or the app associated with the scheme is not installed.

```javascript
// This code might fail if 'myapp' scheme isn't registered or its app isn't installed.
Linking.openURL('myapp://somepath');
```
